From there, you can copy the link from the green **Clone or download** button. Open up your terminal and `cd` into whatever directory you want to keep the exercises on your computer. You might as well just keep it on your desktop (on MacOS, this would be `cd Desktop`). Finally, run the following command to clone the repository.
